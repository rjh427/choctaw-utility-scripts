These are utility scripts I created while working on a proprietary codebase for a client. These scripts do not expose any proprietary code or account credentials. They are provided as examples of my work, for future reference and other educational purposes.   
Correspondingly, these scripts are provided AS-IS, without guarantee or recommendation. If you use them, use at your own risk.
